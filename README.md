# Stimuli of Suzhou Wu perception experiment

This repository contains the base syllables used to resynthesize stimuli for a perception experiment in Suzhou Wu Chinese. There three folders,

- base: the base syllables of one older (F03-older-67) and one middle-aged (F11-middle-aged-49) voice
- stimuli: all the stimuli that were resynthesized using the base syllables
- scripts: the two Praat scripts used to generate the stimuli for unchecked (manipUnchecked.praat) and checked tone (manipChecked.praat) pairs

To get the stimuli, simply open the base syllables in Praat and run the Praat scripts. Note that the path on line 40 needs to be changed.
